<p>I must confess, I started learning to touch-type sometime in November 2008. But I had fallen off the wagon at the beginning of January. To compensate and motivate myself to keep at it, I decided to make this one of my top goals for 2009. </p>
<p>As I mentioned in my earlier post, I'm using <a href="http://www.typingweb.com/">typingweb</a> as my teaching tool of choice. I've tried various touch-typing software,both online and offline, but somehow I just felt comfortable with typingweb. My results are posted below.</p>

<p>I'm not sure how the accuracy is calculated but as you can see, I was making steady progress until the end of December 2008. After that, I hovered around the 25 wpm mark.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>After 2 months, I've noticed the following:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Aiming for accuracy is much better than aiming for speed.</strong> If you try and type too fast, your error rate increases and your frustration as well. Concentrate on typing accurately, by using the assigned finger for the respective letter.&nbsp; Speed comes naturally as your muscles memorise the keys.  </li>
<li><strong>Constant and regular practice is a must. </strong>You need to build some muscle memory and this can only occur with regular practice. My feeling is that the minimum you could do is 3 times a week. I'm aiming for everyday.  </li>
<li><strong>Practice sessions should not be too long.</strong> You fingers start get tired after while. I find that taking a short 3 minute break after every 15-20 minutes helps maintain accuracy. I try and keep each session to a maximum of 1 hour  </li>
<li><strong>Posture and relaxed finger placement is important. </strong>I've found that I make significant improvements when I'm relaxed and sitting correctly. My error rate seems to increase as my posture deteriorates. I wonder if expert level typists have this problem as well.  </li>
<li><strong>The lessons can be frustrating but it does get better. </strong>As with all learning experiences, the first few lessons seem very difficult and you wonder if you ever going to master it. I remember this exact feeling when I was learning to drive a car. But, If you keep it at, it gets better.&nbsp; I found that the second week was much more enjoyable than the first.  </li>
<li><strong>Review your problem keys.</strong>&nbsp; You need to be constructive in your learning. Doing the same mistakes over and over again, and you'll never&nbsp; make real progress. I find that specific letter combinations give me the most problems as opposed to individual letters. For example, my error rate increases when the word has an "i" and a "u" in it.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>At some point I should actually start touch typing for my everyday documents. I hope to do this when my speed is consistently 30 wpm and above. </p>
