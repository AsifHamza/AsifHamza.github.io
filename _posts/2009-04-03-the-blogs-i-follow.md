In January, I talked about the <a href="http://asifhamza.com/2009/01/some-of-my-goals-for-2009-and-how-i-hope-to-achieve-them/" target="_blank">goals I wished to accomplish in 2009</a>.

I’ve been following a number of blogs to help me reach those goals. But the sheer number of useful sites I found made it impossible to visit them every day. So I decided to use a RSS aggregator. At first I was only looking for a desktop client but someone convinced me to give Google Reader a try. I’m glad I listened. Google Reader is an excellent online RSS aggregator and after using it for a two months now I can’t recall how I ever did without. 
Now when I find a blog that has interesting articles, I check to see if it has an RSS feed and add it to Google Reader. The best thing about using an online RSS reader is that I can access via my Nokia E71 anytime.

These are some of the blogs I’ve been following:

### 1. Sites on Electronics, Robotics and Hardware Hacking

1. <a href="http://blog.makezine.com" target="_blank">Make Magazine</a> – The premier hobbyist blog. With this in your RSS reader, you don’t need any other blog. This blog is updated 20-50 times daily so if you haven’t looked at the feed for a few days, you’ll end up with 500 unread posts.

### 2. Symbian Programming
1. <a href="http://www.SymbianResources.com">www.SymbianResources.com</a> – General news info

2. <a href="http://www.Symbian-Freak.com">www.Symbian-Freak.com</a> – General news on Symbian 

3. <a href="http://www.forum.nokia.com">www.forum.nokia.com</a> - Nokia’s developmental forum

### 3. WPF Blogs
Way to many to list here. I imported the opml file for “<a href="http://dotnet.org.za/rudi/archive/2009/01/21/wpf-disciples.aspx" target="_blank">WPF Disciples</a>” group of blogs as well as “WPF Microsoft” and “WPF Community”

### 4. General Life Hacks
1. <a href="http://www.lifehacker.com">www.lifehacker.com</a> – Using technology to improve your life

2. <a title="http://zenhabits.net" href="http://zenhabits.net">zenhabits.net</a> – A blog on goal setting and motivation

3. <a href="http://www.persistanceunlimited.com">www.persistanceunlimited.com</a> – Cool blog on motivation and life skills.
