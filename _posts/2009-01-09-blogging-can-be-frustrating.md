In my quest to start the new year by blogging more frequently, I decided to change the look and feel of this blog. 
What I did not count on was messing up the formatting of my previous posts. I just spent an hour trying to figure out how to get it back to the way it was. I use Windows Live Writer to write edit my posts, and no matter what I tried I just could not figure out how to get the formatting back to something reasonable. 
Just when I was about to give up, I found the setting in Live Writer that updated the style to that of the blog and applied the formatting to all posts.
If anyone else has encountered formatting problems in Live Writer after changing their Wordpress theme, you can save yourself a world of hurt by clicking on View->Update Weblog Style.
