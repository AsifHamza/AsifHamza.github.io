Two recent events here in South Africa, both uploaded to YouTube, showcase the power of social media

The first video showed Australian surfer Mick Fanning's brush with a great white shark during the final of the J-Bay surfing competition in South Africa. The video is embedded below in case you have not seen it.

You can hear the utter shock from the tv presenter and the announcer at the event.

The second video, taken at the Kruger National Park, shows two male lions take down a buck between cars. You can see how the video taker was surprised as he drops the camera at the critical moment.

The first video had 20 million views on YouTube and was featured on international TV. These two videos did more to market South Africa as a tourist destination than any marketing campaign.
