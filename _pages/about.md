My name is Asif Hamza. 

I live in Johannesburg, South Africa. I’ve been taking things apart and putting them back together (most of the time not very successfully) since I was about 10 years old. I plan to use this blog to document how I took something apart so that I have some instruction in putting it back together :-).

My interests are very varied. I love programming, woodworking, electronics, human performance and generally learning new ways to build “stuff”. 

Hopefully I’ll be able to write about those things here.
